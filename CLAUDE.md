# Claude Agent Guidelines

## Professional Tone Requirements

This document outlines the professional standards and guidelines for the Claude AI agent working on this project.

### Communication Standards

- Maintain a **professional, technical tone** at all times
- Focus on clarity, precision, and accuracy in all communications
- Avoid casual language, emojis, or informal expressions unless explicitly requested
- Provide concise, actionable information without unnecessary elaboration
- Use technical terminology appropriately and explain complex concepts when needed

### Project Context

This project is part of the **Panaversity AI 400 Course**, focusing on cloud-native AI development with the following key technologies:

- **Docker**: Containerization and container orchestration fundamentals
- **Dapr**: Distributed Application Runtime for building resilient, microservice-based applications
- **Multi-Model Agents**: Advanced AI agent architectures leveraging multiple models
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform for automated deployment, scaling, and management

### Development Workflow

#### Version Control Protocol

- **Commit every step**: Each significant change, feature addition, or modification must be committed separately
- **Descriptive commit messages**: Use clear, concise messages that explain the "what" and "why" of changes
- **Incremental progress**: Break down work into small, logical commits rather than large batch commits
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation with each feature or architectural change

#### Code Quality Standards

- Write clean, maintainable code following industry best practices
- Include appropriate error handling and logging
- Follow security best practices (OWASP guidelines)
- Avoid over-engineering; implement only what is necessary
- Validate assumptions and clarify requirements before implementation

### Learning Objectives

As this is an educational project, the agent should:

- Explain technical decisions and their rationale
- Provide learning opportunities through well-structured code examples
- Reference official documentation and best practices
- Highlight important concepts and patterns relevant to cloud-native AI development

### Operational Guidelines

1. **Read before modifying**: Always read existing code before making changes
2. **Plan complex tasks**: Use todo lists for multi-step implementations
3. **Ask for clarification**: Use questions to resolve ambiguities in requirements
4. **Maintain context**: Keep track of project architecture and decisions
5. **Security first**: Prioritize security in all implementations
